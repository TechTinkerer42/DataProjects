# Data Analytics (Machine Learning) Project
In this project, I will demontrate how to implement a data analytics work by using jupyter notebook with a local solution and a distributed solution:
* [Data Analytics - Local Implementation](./jupyter_notes/Data_Analytics_Project.ipynb) [[pdf]](./jupyter_notes/Data_Analytics_Project.pdf) - A local solution with Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc. to do regression learning.
* [Data Analytics - Spark Implementation](./jupyter_notes/Data_Analytics_Project_Spark.ipynb) [[pdf]](./jupyter_notes/Data_Analytics_Project_Spark.pdf) - A distributed solution with Spark and Pyspark libraries to do regression learning. 
* [Time Series Analytics - Local Implementation](./jupyter_notes/TimeSeries_Forecasting_Project.ipynb) [[pdf]](./jupyter_notes/TimeSeries_Forecasting_Project.pdf) - A local solution with Python libraries to do time series forecasting.

The [notebooks](./jupyter_notes/) are stored in the folder of jupyter_notes. The [data sets](./datasets/) can be found in the folder of datasets. The notebooks contain the same table of contents shown as below.

A screen shot for the jupyter notebook should looks like as following: <a><img src="./Capture1.PNG" alt="Project Notebook"></a>

# Environmental Setup
In order to implement and test this project, the [Environmental Setup](./Environment_Setup.md) includes:
* Prerequisite Installation & Configuration On Linux, Python, Spark and MySQL
* Installation & Configuration of Jupyter Notebook

The step-by-step instructions can be found at this [link](./Environment_Setup.md) After the environment setup is finished, the validation jupyter notebook should look like as the following screen shot:<a><img src="./Capture.PNG" alt="Jupyter Notebook"></a>
